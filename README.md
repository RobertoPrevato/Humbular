# Humbular
Humbular is a Single Page Application project template, freely inspired by Durandal.
It consists of a bundle of different libraries that cover different needs,
and is meant to offer an intelligible and maintainable folder structure that allows for unit testing, but free from domineering opinions.

## Libraries
Humbular includes the following libraries and provides ways to use them together:

* I.js, for client side localization
* jQuery, as utility library (ajax; promise; etc.)
* Knockout, for dual way binding
* Lodash, for utility functions (map, each, etc.)
* R.js, for dependency injection
* Simrou.js, for client side routing

## Features
* Folder structure and examples to develop areas
* Provides a simple strategy to handle dependency injection
* Client side localization strategy

## Grunt integration
* JavaScript bundling and minification strategy.
* LESS compilation into CSS.

## Tools
* (Recommended) use the [Knight tool](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/Knight) to generate external html templates for Knockout
