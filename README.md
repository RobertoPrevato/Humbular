# Humbular
Humbular is a Single Page Application project template, freely inspired by Durandal.
It consists of a bundle of different libraries that cover different needs,
and is meant to offer an intelligible and maintainable folder structure that allows for unit testing, but is free from domineering opinions.

[Live demo](http://ugrose.com/content/demos/humbular/index.html#/).

## Libraries
Humbular includes the following libraries and provides ways to use them together:

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), for widgets
* [I.js](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/I.js), for client side localization
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), as utility library (ajax; promise; DOM manipulation; etc.)
* [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/), for dual way binding
* [Lodash](https://lodash.com/), for utility functions (map, each, etc.)
* [R.js](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/R.js), for dependency injection
* [Simrou.js](https://github.com/buero-fuer-ideen/Simrou), for client side routing
